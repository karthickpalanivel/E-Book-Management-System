     <h1>Al Enabled Car Parking Using OpenCV</h1>
     <p>Car parking is a common problem faced by drivers in busy urban areas.<br>For example, imagine you are driving to a shopping mall during peak hours. <br>As you approach the mall,you notice that the parking lot is full, and several <br>other cars are circling around looking for available spots.
You join the queue of <br>cars, hoping to find an available spot soon.</p>
     <p>However, as time passes, you realize that the parking lot is overcrowded, and it's<br> becoming increasingly difficult to find a spot. You start to feel frustrated and anxious,<br> knowing that you might be late for your appointment or miss out on a great shopping <br>opportunity.</p>
     <p>AI-enabled car parking using OpenCV is a computer vision-based project that aims to <br>automate the parking process. The project involves developing an intelligent system that <br>can identify empty parking spaces and it gives the count of available parking spots.<br> The system uses a camera and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library to capture <br>live video footage of the parking lot.
